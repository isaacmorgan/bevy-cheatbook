## Stability Warning

Bevy is still a very new and experimental game engine! It has only been
public since August 2020!

While improvements have been happening at an incredible pace, and development
is active, Bevy simply hasn't yet had the time to mature.

*There are no stability guarantees and breaking changes happen often!*

Usually, it not hard to adapt to changes with new releases (or even track
the main git development branch), but you have been warned!
