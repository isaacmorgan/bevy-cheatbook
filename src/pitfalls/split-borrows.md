# Borrow multiple fields from struct

{{#include ../include/links.md}}

When you have a [component][cb::component] or [resource][cb::res], that is
larger struct with multiple fields, sometimes you want to borrow several of
the fields at the same time, possibly mutably.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
struct MyThing {
    a: Foo,
    b: Bar,
}

fn my_system(mut q: Query<&mut MyThing>) {
    for thing in q.iter_mut() {
        helper_func(&thing.a, &mut thing.b); // ERROR!
    }
}

fn helper_func(foo: &Foo, bar: &mut Bar) {
    // do something
}
```

This can result in a compiler error about conflicting borrows:

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `thing` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    |
    |         helper_func(&thing.a, &mut thing.b); // ERROR!
    |         -----------  -----         ^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
    |         |            |
    |         |            immutable borrow occurs here
    |         immutable borrow later used by call
```

The solution is to use the "reborrow" idiom, a common but non-obvious trick in Rust programming:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
        // add this at the start of the for loop, before using `thing`:
        let thing = &mut *thing;
```

Note that this line triggers [change detection][cb::change-detection]. Even if
you don't modify the data afterwards, the component gets marked as changed.

## Explanation

Bevy typically gives you access to your data via special wrapper types (like
[`Res<T>`][bevy::Res], [`ResMut<T>`][bevy::ResMut], and [`Mut<T>`][bevy::Mut]
(when [querying][cb::query] for components mutably)). This lets Bevy track
access to the data.

These are "smart pointer" types that use the Rust [`Deref`][std::Deref]
trait to dereference to your data. They usually work seamlessly and you
don't even notice them.

However, in a sense, they are opaque to the compiler. The Rust language
allows fields of a struct to be borrowed individually, when you have direct
access to the struct, but this does not work when it is wrapped in another type.

The "reborrow" trick shown above, effectively converts the wrapper
into a regular Rust reference. `*thing` dereferences the wrapper via
[`DerefMut`][std::DerefMut], and then `&mut` borrows it mutably. You now have
`&mut MyStuff` instead of `Mut<MyStuff>`.
