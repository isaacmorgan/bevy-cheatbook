# Hosting on GitHub Pages

{{#include ../../include/links.md}}

GitHub Pages is a hosting service that allows you to publish your website
on GitHub's servers.

For more details, visit the official [GitHub Pages
documentation][ghpages::docs].

Deploying a website (like your WASM game) to GitHub pages is done by
putting the files in a special branch in a GitHub repository. You could
create a separate repository for this, but you could also do it from the
same repository as your source code.

You will need the final website files for deployment.

---

Create an empty branch in your git repository:

```shell
git checkout --orphan web
git reset --hard
```

You should now be in an empty working directory.

Put all files necessary for hosting, including your HTML, WASM, JavaScript,
and `assets` files, and commit them into git:

```shell
git add *
git commit
```

(or better, manually list your files in the above command, in place of the `*` wildcard)

Push your new branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push -u origin web --force
```

In the GitHub Web UI, go to the repository settings, go to the "GitHub Pages"
section, then under "Source" pick the branch "web" and the `/` (root) folder.
Then click "Save".

Wait a little bit, and your site should become available at
`https://your-name.github.io/your-repo`.
